/**
 * dsh-weknora-win, HOST half.
 *
 * Installing this bundle puts one row into the profile and that row is enough: the
 * plugin injects `weknora_run`, and the tool owns the server's lifecycle. Nothing
 * is spawned at mount time — the plugin's only work here is registering the tool
 * and making the teardown path explicit.
 *
 * The plugin imports nothing from the harness at runtime. `tool.js` mirrors the
 * documented `ToolDefinition` shape, which is what keeps this package loadable in
 * a deployment whose `@deepseek-ai/*` copies differ from the dev checkout's.
